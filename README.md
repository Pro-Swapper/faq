# Frequently Asked Questions

- **Does Pro Swapper Ban?**

Pro Swapper will **NOT** ban you from Fortnite as Epic Games does not seem to ban for file modification to modify cosmetics.

- **Does Pro Swapper work on GeForce Now?**

GeForce Now is Nvidia's "[Cloud Gaming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_gaming)" service, this plays **Fortnite** on another PC so you're playing Fortnite on a computer which isn't yours, which means you cannot install third party programs/software such as Pro Swapper.

- **Why can't other people see my skin?**

The swapper is client sided which means that only you are able to see it because of the way that Fortnite processes skin data.

- **Does Pro Swapper work on PS4, Xbox, Nintendo Switch, Mobile?**


The swapper is only available for Windows. (Most recommended on Windows 10)


# Swapper Not Opening

If the swapper isn't opening try the following:
- Turn off your anti virus, turn off real time protection from Windows security.
- Try opening the swapper as Administrator
- If the swapper is still not opening try putting it in a different folder (or your desktop)
- If there is a .NET error or something like that try installing the 4.6.1 .NET framework [here](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/net461 "Microsoft's .NET 4.6.1 framework")
- Make sure you downloadeded Pro Swapper from the official link [here](https://link-to.net/86737/proswapper)

# Errors

### **When using emotes DO NOT put the emote in your main locker wheel, favourite it instead**


If Fortnite is crashing / not opening you can try verifying Fortnite:
1. Open Pro Swapper
2. Goto the settings tab
3. Click ["Verify"](https://github.com/Pro-Swapper/faq/blob/main/Images/Verify.png?raw=true)
4. Swap the item(s) you want.

# Kicked Out of game:

- **If you get this error it means you swapped too many items**
###### There is no real maximum numbers of items you can swap but it's good to keep it less than about 4, some items together are more likely to kick, you can try and experiment to see what kicks and doesn't kick.
